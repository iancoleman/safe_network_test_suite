This is not a very serious repo, it will probably break regularly and best
practices are not always followed. It's a quick and dirty job. But I'm open to
PRs / issues and if it starts become very useful to others then maybe things
will tighten up a bit.

# Quick start

```sh
$ ./start_network.sh
$ ./run_all_tests.sh
$ ./end_network.sh
```
